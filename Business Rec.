## Business Recommendations

Based on the final churn prediction models and feature importance analysis, the following actionable recommendations are proposed for ConnectTel’s retention strategy:

### 1. Target Month-to-Month Contract Customers
Customers on month-to-month contracts consistently showed the highest churn risk across all models.
**Recommendation:**  
Prioritize these customers for retention campaigns by offering incentives such as discounted upgrades to annual or two-year contracts, especially within the first year of service.

### 2. Focus on Early-Tenure Customers
Shorter customer tenure was one of the strongest predictors of churn.
**Recommendation:**  
Implement early-stage engagement programs, including proactive onboarding support, service quality check-ins, and personalized communication during the first 3–6 months.

### 3. Address High Cost-to-Tenure Imbalance
Customers with high charges relative to their tenure were significantly more likely to churn.
**Recommendation:**  
Introduce targeted pricing adjustments, bundled plans, or loyalty credits for high-paying customers early in their lifecycle to improve perceived value.

### 4. Increase Adoption of Value-Added Services
Customers without premium support, security, or bundled services showed higher churn probability.
**Recommendation:**  
Promote value-added services such as technical support and online security through limited-time trials or bundled discounts to increase customer stickiness.

### 5. Prioritize Recall in Retention Strategy
Model evaluation showed that missing churn-prone customers (false negatives) has a higher business cost than contacting some non-churning customers.
**Recommendation:**  
Retention teams should prioritize recall over precision when using the churn model, accepting limited outreach inefficiency to minimize lost revenue from undetected churn.

### 6. Deploy an Interpretable Model for Business Trust
Although gradient boosting models achieved marginally higher performance, Logistic Regression provided comparable AUC-ROC with greater interpretability.
**Recommendation:**  
Deploy Logistic Regression in production to ensure transparency, easier monitoring, and clearer communication of churn drivers to business stakeholders.
